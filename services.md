## Things to Note
* Logging is disabled at the server level.
* These services are intended to be used for the purpose of privacy and nothing more.
* Services will mostly follow a default configuration. Due to this, if you are after any sort of privacy policy, you can generally follow what an official instance of any of these projects state in their respective policies. Alterations to the default configurations are generally aesthetic in nature.

## Getting Help/Giving Feedback
Feel free to reach out to me if you need help or have feedback for any of the services I provide. The best way to reach out to me is through Matrix by joining the [#services:kennyqin.com](https://matrix.to/#/#services:kennyqin.com) room.

## Donate
These services all have ongoing service and maintenance costs. If you use the services and would like to support me, please consider donating by dropping me a little. You can also consider supporting the projects directly by following the links in the **Service** column in the table above and seeing how they can be supported.
