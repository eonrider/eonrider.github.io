# Thoughts

This page is a collection of topics that I've decided to put some effort into fleshing out.

## 📈 *Big Tech*
I am wary of the power *Big Tech* has in our lives and their place in mass surveillance and censorship. I used to use Google, Microsoft and Facebook products without a second thought just like the average consumer.

I avoid using Google services directly. Some of the Google products I still use, I access through software that act as proxies. I use a de-Googled phone. I use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) on my daily driver and a debloated installation of Windows 10 for gaming. ([ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) is an awesome project by Valve which will hopefully relinquish the dependency gamers have on Windows. Also, yes... [DRM](https://www.fckdrm.com/)...) I have deleted my Facebook account and no longer use WhatsApp. I keep in contact with all the important people in my life through [Signal](https://signal.org/) and [Threema](https://threema.ch/en/).

I am concerned about Amazon's direct role in physical surveillance particularly through their Ring products.

I am interested in decentralised architectures as they seem to solve many of the issues critics have of Big Tech. There are several projects out there that act as decentralised alternatives to the centralised behemoths we have today which I'm fascinated by through their way of governance. Some examples include [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/) (federated Twitter), [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) (federated YouTube), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) (federated Instagram) and [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) (federated messaging).

## 🔐 Basic Digital Practices Everyone Should be Following
The average person in developed countries [spends several hours per day exposing themselves in the digital world](https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/) without having any understanding of the threats posed to them. Admittedly, I used to use the internet with little regard for my privacy and security. One e-mail address I no longer use is associated with over 10 compromised accounts according to [HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)!

> I would use an ad blocker. I would use a password manager. I would block
 third-party cookies in the browser. These last three are steps that 
absolutely everyone should consider, because they're simple, cost little
 or nothing, and protect you while making your phone faster.
 
PrivacyTools.io has an easy-to-follow guide on [browser configuration](https://privacytools.io/browsers/) and recommendations for [password managers](https://privacytools.io/software/passwords/). I recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to all my friends.

Additional:
* Associate your most important accounts with a secondary mobile number that is not used for any other reason. Keep it to yourself and never give it out to others. [SIM swapping attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam) occur because every single service in the modern day asks for a mobile number despite not really needing one. This data eventually becomes part of a data breach and becomes part of a digital profile on you in a database somewhere which may be accessed and used by a malicious actor to target you.
* Similarly, have a unique e-mail address for each of your important accounts. Most popular e-mail providers including Gmail and Outlook support [*plus addressing*](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html). Instead of using `john.doe@gmail.com`, use `john.doe+bankname@gmail.com` or better yet, `john.doe+banknameh3j8ad4@gmail.com` to make it almost impossible to guess. Malicious actors will have a hard time getting your login for services that use an e-mail addresses as a user name or as part of some verification process. (Some people will tell you this trick works with anti-spam but pretty much anyone in the business of aggregating data will know to strip it down to the base e-mail address.)
* Enable [two-factor authentication](https://twofactorauth.org/) for at least your important accounts. This is absolutely critical for your e-mail service and your password manager. For the average person this will be an implementation of [TOTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238). Many services tend to word their instructions as if Google Authenticator is the only option. While it is [probably fine](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/latest/), I recommend the open source [andOTP for Android users](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP) ([report](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/org.shadowice.flocke.andotp/latest/) for comparison) or [Tofu for iOS users](https://www.tofuauth.com/) (see [App Privacy](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/tofu-authenticator/id1082229305) section).

## 🎰 Microtransactions, Loot Boxes and In-Game Currencies in Video Games
I feel that the video game industry is very manipulative and predatory with their business models. Many of these concepts are relatable to age-restricted gambling and [regulation is increasingly being pressured in many countries to finally catch up with the industry](https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2020/11/24/82169/spains-dgoj-urges-government-to-reclassify-loot-boxes-as-games-of-chance/). Video games which initially seem harmless are not immune as they can burn you overnight without warning. [The microtransaction incident for Payday 2 in 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3ow3q5/fuck_you_overkill/) is a grand example. I respect video game critic [Jim Sterling](https://www.youtube.com/user/JimSterling) who has been calling out poor industry practices for many years now.

I believe practise of [patient gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers) is the way to go for people who have a hobby in gaming. The key premise is to only emotionally associate with a game once the *hype* is **gone** and the developers/publishers have moved on. By then, it is clear what titles to avoid. Obviously, there are some pitfalls in that the player will not feel like they are part of *something* and other gamers often have an irrational knee-jerk reaction to anything that isn't the **latest and greatest** so finding others for games with a multiplayer focus can be challenging.

I am bothered that many people knowingly subject themselves to video games that follow predatory practices when many games without them are available. Players of these games can have somehow have a semi-intellectual conversation amongst themselves about how they are having fun in a carefully crafted orchestration of manipulation.
