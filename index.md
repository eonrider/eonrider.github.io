# Welcome to my website!

## Who I am
I work as a software engineer professionally in Sydney, Australia. I have been in the role since 2016.

I am an enthusiast of digital privacy and security. I have considered being more involved in this space publically but I have not yet done so. Look out for that in 2021!

## Interests
* Standards - I believe in the value of interoperability and standards have a big role in that. I use the term very loosely. Some *standards* I care about greatly include grammar in spoken and written languages and coding standards.
* Ecology - I'm not an expert but I'm becoming increasingly observant of the impact I, as an individual, and the human species as a whole have on the world.
* Minimalism - Due to my interests in digital privacy and ecology, I practice minimalism in both digital and non-digital spaces.
* Running - I only really run casually. I'm not bad though!

## My thoughts on some topics

### Big Tech
I am wary of the power *Big Tech* has in our lives and their place in surveillance. I used to use Google, Microsoft and Facebook products without a second thought just like the average consumer.

I now barely use any Google services directly. Some of the Google products I still use, I access through software that act as proxies. I use a de-Googled phone. I use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) on my daily driver with a debloated installation of Windows 10 on my gaming desktop. ([ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) is an awesome project by Valve which will hopefully bring freedom to all the gamers dependent on Windows. Also, yes... [DRM](https://www.fckdrm.com/)...) I have deleted my Facebook account and no longer use WhatsApp. I keep in contact with all the important people in my life through [Signal](https://signal.org/). (The people who truly value you will follow you.)

Amazon has not really held a big place in my life but I know it does in many others. I am concerned about Amazon's direct role in mass surveillance through their Ring products.

### Social norms
In many western countries, children are brought up with the concept of critical thinking. Why then, are so many people judgemental as soon as you go against a social norm. I spend a fair amount of time thinking about what makes sense to me and the aftermath of going against what others blindly **do**. I eat ice cream for breakfast if I'm in the mood and a Sausage and Egg McMuffin for dinner if I please. I don't say *bless you* because I believe it be extremely archaic. I'll wear a fancy suit if my employer requires it but fortunately, my current place of employment does not. I don't make my bed because [there is objectively no reason to](https://www.lifehack.org/317021/scientists-tell-you-why-making-your-bed-disgusting-and-bad-for-your-health).
