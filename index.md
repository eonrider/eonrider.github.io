# Welcome to my website!

## Who I am
I work as a software engineer professionally in Sydney, Australia. I have a [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennyqin); not that I use it at all really.

I have experience in developing and deploying a range of technologies from both web and desktop applications in Windows environments to those in Linux.

I am an advocate of privacy and security. I am actively looking to see how I can be more involved in this space. As a starting point, I host some online services that are free to use by anyone.

## Interests

### ✅ Standards
I believe in the value of interoperability and standards have a big role in that. I use the term very *loosely*. Some standards I care about greatly include grammar in spoken and written languages and coding standards.

### 🌏 Ecology
I'm not an expert but I've become increasingly observant of the impact I, as an individual, and the human species as a whole have on the world. I am currently exploring activities in this space.

### 🤏 Minimalism
Due to my interests in digital privacy and ecology, I practice minimalism in both digital and physical spaces.

### 🏃‍♂️ Running
I only really run casually. I'm not bad though! At my best, I've run a long distance at a sub-5:00 per kilometre pace. I enjoy running as it gives me the freedom to go to places with a carbon footprint close to 0. It gives me moments to think and learn whether that be by listening to an audiobook or podcast or just self-reflection in silence.

### 🙌 Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
FOSS exists as one, if the not the only one, model that gives full transparency of behaviour. I believe that any self-claimed privacy-respecting software product should not be depended upon unless it is FOSS. (Ahem... Apple.)
