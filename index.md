# Welcome to my website!

## Who I am
I work as a software engineer professionally in Sydney, Australia. I have a [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennyqin); not that I use it at all really.

I am an enthusiast of digital privacy and security. I have considered being more involved in this space publically but I have not yet done so. Look out for that in 2021! (I have already annoyed all my close friends already about the importance of *x* or *y* or *z* ~~and I crave to do it to many more people~~.)

## Interests

### ✅ Standards
I believe in the value of interoperability and standards have a big role in that. I use the term very *loosely*. Some standards I care about greatly include grammar in spoken and written languages and coding standards.

### 🌏 Ecology
I'm not an expert but I've become increasingly observant of the impact I, as an individual, and the human species as a whole have on the world. I'm much more considerate of how the food on my plate gets there. I stick to drinking water so that I reduce the amount of single-use waste that comes from consuming alternatives. I know my individual actions are insignificant in the grand scheme of things. I may look into joining a movement on climate change in the future.

### 🤏 Minimalism
Due to my interests in digital privacy and ecology, I practice minimalism in both digital and non-digital spaces.

### 🏃‍♂️ Running
I only really run casually. I'm not bad though! At my best, I've run a long distance at a sub-5:00 minute pace. I enjoy running as it gives me the freedom to go to places with a carbon footprint close to 0. It gives me moments to think and learn whether that be by listening to an audiobook or podcast or just self-reflection in silence.

### 🙌 Free and open source software (FOSS)
It was only once I went down the privacy rabbit hole that I truly started appreciating FOSS. FOSS exists as one, if the not the only one, model that gives full transparency of any unwanted behaviour. I believe that any software product that claims to be privacy respecting cannot be trusted unless it is FOSS. (Ahem... Apple.)

## My thoughts on some topics

### 📈 Big Tech
I am wary of the power *Big Tech* has in our lives and their place in mass surveillance. I used to use Google, Microsoft and Facebook products without a second thought just like the average consumer.

I now barely use any Google services directly. Some of the Google products I still use, I access through software that act as proxies. I use a de-Googled phone. I use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) on my daily driver with a debloated installation of Windows 10 for gaming. ([ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) is an awesome project by Valve which will hopefully bring freedom to all the gamers dependent on Windows. Also, yes... [DRM](https://www.fckdrm.com/)...) I have deleted my Facebook account and no longer use WhatsApp. I keep in contact with all the important people in my life through [Signal](https://signal.org/).

I am concerned about Amazon's direct role in mass surveillance particularly through their Ring products.

### 🔐 Basic digital practices absolutely everyone should be following
The average person in developed countries [spends several hours per day exposing themselves in the digital world](https://blog.rescuetime.com/screen-time-stats-2018/) without having any understanding of the threats posed to them. Admittedly, I used to use the internet with little regard for my privacy and security. One e-mail address I no longer use is associated with over 10 compromised accounts according to [HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)!

Before listening to me, listen to [@Snowden](https://nitter.net/Snowden/status/1175433355921436673):
> I would use an ad blocker. I would use a password manager. I would block
 third-party cookies in the browser. These last three are steps that 
absolutely everyone should consider, because they're simple, cost little
 or nothing, and protect you while making your phone faster.
 
PrivacyTools.io has an easy-to-follow guide on [browser configuration](https://privacytools.io/browsers/) and recommendations for [password managers](https://privacytools.io/software/passwords/). I recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to all my friends.

Additional:
* Associate your most important accounts with a secondary mobile number that is not used for any other reason. Keep it to yourself and never give it out to others. [SIM swapping attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam) occur because every single service in the modern day asks for a mobile number despite not really needing one. This data eventually becomes part of a data breach and becomes part of a digital profile on you in a database somewhere which may be accessed and used by a malicious actor to target you.
* Similarly, have a unique e-mail address for each of your important accounts. Despite how I feel about using Gmail in the current day, most people are using the Google mail service which supports [*plus addressing*](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html) (don't know if there's an official name for this). Instead of using `john.doe@gmail.com`, use `john.doe+bankname@gmail.com` or better yet, `john.doe+banknameh3j8ad4@gmail.com` to make it almost impossible to guess. The advantage of this is that malicious actors will have a hard time getting your login for services that use an e-mail addresses as a user name or as part of some security verification process. Other popular e-mail services such as Outlook also offer the same functionality. (Some people will tell you this trick works with anti-spam but pretty much anyone in the business of aggregating data on people will know to strip it down to the base e-mail address.)
* Enable [two-factor authentication](https://twofactorauth.org/) for at least your important accounts. This is absolutely critical for your e-mail service and your password manager. For the average person this will be an implementation of [TOTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238). Many services like to treat Google Authenticator as the only option. While Google Authenticator is [probably fine](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/latest/), I recommend the open source [andOTP for Android users](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP) ([report](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/org.shadowice.flocke.andotp/latest/) for comparison) or [Tofu for iOS users](https://www.tofuauth.com/) (sorry, no report for you).

### 🤨 Social norms
In many western countries, children are brought up with the concept of critical thinking. Why, then, are so many people judgemental as soon as you go against a social norm? I feel that it's important to spend some amount of time thinking about what makes sense and the aftermath of going against what others *blindly* do.

It's not inherently *wrong* to eat ice cream for breakfast if someone is in the mood to do so or a Sausage and Egg McMuffin for dinner if they please. I feel that saying *bless you* when someone sneezes is extremely archaic and unnecessary. I agree with Richard Stallman when he says that [there is an absurd amount of social pressure on men to wear a tie as a way of sucking up to the company](https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html). Many people make their beds even though there are objectively [reasons not to](https://www.lifehack.org/317021/scientists-tell-you-why-making-your-bed-disgusting-and-bad-for-your-health). (Some people say they do it as it gives them an immediate sense of accomplishment. In that case, more power to them.)

### 🎰 Microtransactions, loot boxes and in-game currencies in video games
I feel that the video game industry is very predatory with their pricing models. Many of these concepts are relatable to age-restricted gambling and [regulation is increasingly being pressured in many countries to finally catch up with the industry](https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2020/11/24/82169/spains-dgoj-urges-government-to-reclassify-loot-boxes-as-games-of-chance/). Video games which initially seem harmless are not immune as they can burn you overnight without warning. [The microtransaction incident for Payday 2 in 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3ow3q5/fuck_you_overkill/) is a grand example. I respect video game critic [Jim Sterling](https://www.youtube.com/user/JimSterling) who has been calling out poor industry practices for many years now.

I believe practise of [patient gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers) is the way to go for people who have a hobby in gaming. The key premise is to only emotionally associate with a game once the *hype* is **gone** and the developers/publishers have moved on. By then, it is clear what titles to avoid. Obviously there are some pitfalls in that you will not feel like you are part of *something* and other gamers often have an irrational knee-jerk reaction to anything that isn't the **latest and greatest** so finding others for games with a multiplayer focus can be challenging.

I find it troubling that many people knowingly subject themselves to video games that follow predatory practices when many games without them are available. Players of these games can have somehow have a semi-intellectual conversation amongst themselves about how they are having fun in a carefully crafted orchestration of manipulation.
