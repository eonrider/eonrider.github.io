# Welcome to my website!

## Who I am
I work as a software engineer professionally in Sydney, Australia. I have experience in developing and deploying a range of technologies from both web and desktop applications in Windows and Linux environments. In my spare time, I like to work on Linux sysadmin-type activities.

I am an advocate of privacy and security. I am actively looking to see how I can be more involved in this space. As a starting point, I host some online services that are free to use by anyone.

## Interests

### ✅ Standards and Interoperability
I believe in the value of interoperability and standards have a big role in that. I use the term very *loosely*. Some standards I care about greatly include grammar in spoken and written languages, coding standards and communication protocols.

### 🌏 Ecology
I'm not an expert but I've become increasingly observant of the impact I, as an individual, and the human species as a whole have on the world. I am currently exploring activities in this space by looking at volunteer work.

### 🤏 Minimalism
Due to my interests in digital privacy and ecology, I practice minimalism in both digital and physical spaces.

### 🏃‍♂️ Running
I only really run casually. I'm not bad though! At my best, I've run a long distance at a sub-5:00 per kilometre pace. I enjoy running as it gives me the freedom to go to places with a carbon footprint close to 0. It gives me moments to think and learn whether that be by listening to an audiobook or podcast or just self-reflection in ambience.

### 🙌 Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
FOSS exists as the only software model that gives full transparency of behaviour. I believe that any self-claimed privacy-respecting software product should not be depended upon unless it is FOSS. (Ahem... Apple.)

## Contact
My preferred methods of contact are either Matrix or Threema which are both linked in the footer. Session is another secure communication tool I use but you will need to reach out to me using some other method to request my Session ID. Signal will be available once the username feature is available.
