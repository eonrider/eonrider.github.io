# Welcome to my website!

## Who I am
I work as a software engineer professionally in Sydney, Australia. I have been in the role since 2016.

I am an enthusiast of digital privacy and security. I have a good understanding of a user's relationship with *Big Tech*. I have considered being more involved in this space publically but I have not yet done so. Look out for that in 2021!

## Interests
* Standards - I believe in the value of interoperability and standards have a big role in that. I use the term very loosely. Some *standards* I care about greatly include grammar in spoken and written languages and coding standards.
* Ecology - I'm not an expert but I'm becoming increasingly observant of the impact I, as an individual, and the human species as a whole have on the world.
* Minimalism - Due to my interests in digital privacy and ecology, I practice minimalism in both digital and non-digital spaces.
* Running - I only really run casually. I'm not bad though!
