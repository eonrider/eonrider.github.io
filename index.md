# Welcome to my website!

## Who I am
I work as a software engineer professionally in Sydney, Australia. I have been in the role since 2016.

I am an enthusiast of digital privacy and security. I have considered being more involved in this space publically but I have not yet done so. Look out for that in 2021!

## Interests

### Standards
I believe in the value of interoperability and standards have a big role in that. I use the term very loosely. Some *standards* I care about greatly include grammar in spoken and written languages and coding standards.

### Ecology
I'm not an expert but I'm becoming increasingly observant of the impact I, as an individual, and the human species as a whole have on the world. I'm much more considerate of how the food on my plate gets there. I stick to drinking water so that I reduce the amount of single-use waste that comes from consuming alternatives. I know my individual actions are insignificant in the grand scheme of things. I may look into joining a movement on climate change in the future.

### Minimalism
Due to my interests in digital privacy and ecology, I practice minimalism in both digital and non-digital spaces.

### Running
I only really run casually. I'm not bad though! At my best, I've run a long distance at a sub-5:00 minute pace.

### Free and open source software (FOSS)
It was only once I went down the privacy rabbit hole that I truly started appreciating FOSS. FOSS exists as one, if the not the only one, model that gives full transparency of any unwanted behaviour. I believe that any software product that claims to be privacy focused cannot be trusted unless it is FOSS. (Ahem... Apple.)

## My thoughts on some topics

### Big Tech
I am wary of the power *Big Tech* has in our lives and their place in mass surveillance. I used to use Google, Microsoft and Facebook products without a second thought just like the average consumer.

I now barely use any Google services directly. Some of the Google products I still use, I access through software that act as proxies. I use a de-Googled phone. I use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) on my daily driver with a debloated installation of Windows 10 on my gaming desktop. ([ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) is an awesome project by Valve which will hopefully bring freedom to all the gamers dependent on Windows. Also, yes... [DRM](https://www.fckdrm.com/)...) I have deleted my Facebook account and no longer use WhatsApp. I keep in contact with all the important people in my life through [Signal](https://signal.org/). (The people who truly value you will follow you.)

Amazon has not really held a big place in my life but I know it does in many others. I am concerned about Amazon's direct role in mass surveillance through their Ring products.

### Basic digital practices absolutely everyone should be following
The average person in developed countries spends several hours per day exposing themselves in the digital world without having any understanding of the threats posed to them. Admittedly, I used to use the internet with little regard for my privacy and security. The e-mail address I no longer use is associated with 12 compromised accounts according to [HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)!

To quote [@Snowden](https://nitter.net/Snowden/status/1175433355921436673):
> I would use an ad blocker. I would use a password manager. I would block
 third-party cookies in the browser. These last three are steps that 
absolutely everyone should consider, because they're simple, cost little
 or nothing, and protect you while making your phone faster.
 
PrivacyTools.io has an easy-to-follow guide on [browser configuration](https://privacytools.io/browsers/) and recommendations for [password managers](https://privacytools.io/software/passwords/). I recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to all my friends.

Additional:
* Get a mobile number to use specifically for all your important accounts. [SIM swapping attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam) occur because every single service in the modern day asks for a mobile number despite not really needing one. This data will eventually be part of a data breach and become part of a digital profile on you in a database somewhere which may be accessed by a malicious actor. Some mobile carriers provide **Pay-As-You-Go** plans which allow you to have access to a number will a minimal cost. In Australia, Amaysim provides [one such service](https://www.amaysim.com.au/plans/mobile-plans/as-you-go/).
* Similarly, have a unique e-mail address for each of your important accounts. Despite how I feel about using Gmail in 2020, most people are using the Google mail service which supports [*plus addressing*](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html) (don't know if there's an official name for this). Instead of using `john.doe@gmail.com`, use `john.doe+bankname@gmail.com` or better yet, `john.doe+banknameh3j8ad4@gmail.com` to make it almost impossible to guess. The advantage of this is that malicious actors will have a hard time getting your login for services that use an email as a user name or as but some security verification processes. I believe other popular e-mail services such as Outlook also offer the same functionality. (Some people will tell you this trick works with anti-spam but pretty much anyone in the business of aggregating data on people will know to strip it down to the base e-mail address.)

### Social norms
In many western countries, children are brought up with the concept of critical thinking. Why then, are so many people judgemental as soon as you go against a social norm. I spend a fair amount of time thinking about what makes sense to me and the aftermath of going against what others blindly **do**. I eat ice cream for breakfast if I'm in the mood and a Sausage and Egg McMuffin for dinner if I please. I don't say *bless you* when someone sneezes because I believe it be extremely archaic. I'll unwillingly wear a fancy suit if my employer requires it but fortunately, my current place of employment does not. I don't make my bed because [there is objectively no reason to](https://www.lifehack.org/317021/scientists-tell-you-why-making-your-bed-disgusting-and-bad-for-your-health).

### Microtransactions, loot boxes and in-game currencies in video games
I feel that the video game industry is becoming increasingly predatory with their pricing models. Many of these concepts are relatable to gambling and regulation in many countries has finally been catching up with the industry. Video games which initially seem harmless can burn you overnight without warning. I learnt this in 2015 through the sudden addition of microtransactions in [Payday 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3ow3q5/fuck_you_overkill/) where the passion I had in a single gaming community was destroyed instantly. I respect video game critic [Jim Sterling](https://www.youtube.com/user/JimSterling) who has been calling out poor industry practices for many years now.

Consequently, I practise [patient gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers). The key premise for me is to only emotionally associate myself with a game once the *hype* is gone and the developers/publishers have moved on. Obviously there are some pitfalls in that you will not feel like you are part of *something* and some people have an irrational knee-jerk reaction to anything that isn't the *latest and greatest* so finding others for game with a multiplayer focus can be challenging.
